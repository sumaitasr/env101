                    <p>As a group, we participated in a citizen science project called Nature’s Notebook. 
                        Over the course of 3-4 weeks, we collected data tracking the change in tree foliage.
                         We contributed to a project that helps scientists track changes in the timing of plant seasonal activity.</p>

                </br>
            </br>
                    <p>Participatory science engages non-scientists in the process of collecting data. Getting the general public 
                        involved in the science community raises awareness of problems that the scientific community is trying to solve. 
                        Participatory science is also beneficial to scientists because they gain a wide range of data to further evaluate. If scientists were solely collecting data, they would have a smaller amount of data to work with. But through engaging non-scientists, there is a larger amount of data to analyze, resulting in more accurate conclusions. 
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Nature's Notebook was extremely user-friendly. We didnt have any training for 
                    the data collection yet, it was very easy to use. Data collection applications 
                    are specifically designed to be easy to use and not intimidating since science 
                    is for everyone. As such it is very possible to implement participatory science 
                    in all age groups. Introducing participatory science to younger children helps 
                    foster curiosity and scientific understanding. It would be extremely beneficial 
                    to children's academic growth to show science through simple experiments. 
                    Also, the added time outside would promote social and physical well-being.

                    <h3>The Importance of Our Project’s Topic</h3>
                    <p>Overall, trees are crucial to every ecosystem regardless of location and urbanization. As such it is important to 
                        track the health of the trees, one way being tracking the phenological changes throughout the seasons. 
                        Phenological changes are shifts in the timing of important life cycle events, such as flowering, and leaf fall, 
                        in response to climate change. In the Fall, trees are known to change from vibrant green to reds, oranges, and 
                        yellows. Our job was to track these changes with climate change in mind. The timeframe of the leaves changing 
                        color has been shifted to changing later in Fall. While it may seem like a small detail, this is very important. 
                        Many organisms rely on the leaves changing color and falling. Fallen leaves are called leaf litter. Leaf litter 
                        contributes to nutrient cycling, and provides shelter and habitats for many animals. Finally, leaf litter creates
                         a layer of organic matter that contributes to a healthy soil structure. The topic of observing phenological 
                         changes’ response to climate change is extremely important for ecosystem health. </p>

                        Throughout our data collection in this project we have done many things. We have done methods like monitoring 
                        the physical changes in trees through logging it in an app, and we have also done things like comparing our data 
                        to more long term well known data. Both of these are very important for when you enter the stages of analysation 
                        of your data.

                    <h3>Findings</h3>
                    <p>We found that over time the phenophase of the trees that we did the data collection on, did not change drastically.
                         The color of the trees started to show in late October. We hypothesized that this could be due to the drastic 
                         changes in atmospheric temperatures during the period of time that we collected data</p>

                        reducing your carbon footprint by turning lights off, composting, or 
                        even participating in collecting data for large-scale experiments. </p>
